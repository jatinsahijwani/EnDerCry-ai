# EnDerCry AI

![Project Logo](public/NillionHealtLogo.png) 

EnDerCry is a program that demonstrates the power of blind computation in a healthcare setting. Making use of Nillion's multiparty computation, the program provides a breast cancer image classification test performed over multiple health providers.

## Problem:
The article *"Sharing Is Caring-Data Sharing Initiative in Healthcare"*[[1]](#1) highlights a concern in regards to who gets access to all the health data. High valued data is expected to further grow in value due to advances in AI/ML and other emerging technologies. Do you know if your health provider can provide you the best care when you need it?

## Objective: 
Make use of modern cryptography to prevent barriers in the healthcare industry and ensure the world's most important data type, medical imaging, can be shared in a way that is fair and secure.

# Demo
![Diagram](public/Diagram.png)

The diagram illustrates the program's demo. There are two primary sections, a test computed over a full dataset and a test computed on Nillion's protocol on combining multiple datasets.

### Full Dataset Test
- 550+ image data instances
- 30 parameters and 1 target value (Diagnosis)
- 80/20 Split, (80) Training data, (20) Testing
- 3 Figures of Plot Distributions - Full, Small Subset, Large Subset
- Simple classification model use for computing thetas and test predictions 
- Single randomly selected test instance used, not a full test evaluation. Do not use program for predictions. Purpose of testing is to compare calculated values.

### Multi Party Nillion Test
- Small Subset (25%) and Large Subset (75%)
- 30 parameters and 1 target value (Diagnosis)
- Weighted average method used when combining thetas from subsets
- A scaling factor was applied to satisfy integer requirements in Nillion's Nada program

# About the program

## ✅ Secure Multi-Party Computation (Blind computation)

- [Nillion](https://nillion.com/) - Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high value data in the same way that blockchains decentralized transactions.

## ✅ Diagnostic Imaging Cancer Data

- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) - The dataset used in the program is related to diagnostic imaging data focused on breast cancer classification. As included in the site's information, the features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. It describes characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
